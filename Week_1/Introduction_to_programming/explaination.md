# 🧠 Class 1: Introduction to Programming & Python

Welcome to your very first Python class! 🎉
In this session, we’ll understand what programming actually means, why it’s useful, and how Python makes it simple and fun to learn.

# 💡 What Is Programming?

Programming is the process of instructing a computer to perform tasks.
Just like we use English or Urdu to communicate with people, we use programming languages to communicate with computers.

A program is simply a set of instructions written in a specific language that the computer can understand and execute.

For example:
If you tell a computer to “add two numbers,” you’re programming it to follow that instruction.

# 🧩 Why Learn Programming?

Learning to program helps you:

🧠Think logically — break big problems into smaller steps

⚙️Automate tasks — make computers do repetitive work for you

💼Build projects — from games and web apps to AI tools

🚀Boost your career opportunities — programming skills are in high demand

# 🐍 Why Python?

Python is one of the most beginner-friendly programming languages in the world.
It’s used everywhere — from web development and automation to artificial intelligence and data science.

Here’s why Python is great for beginners:

✅ Simple and readable syntax (it looks almost like English!)

✅ Huge community and tons of free learning resources

✅ Works on any computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)

✅ Great for both beginners and professionals

#⚙️ Setting Up Python

Before writing your first program:

# Install Python
👉 Download from python.org/downloads

# Check Installation
Open your terminal or command prompt and type:
```bash
python --version
```

You should see something like:
```bash
Python 3.12.0
```


# Install a Code Editor
We’ll use VS Code, a popular and beginner-friendly editor.

#✍️ Writing Your First Python Program

Let’s write your first line of Python code!
```bash
print("Hello, Python!")
```

#🧠 What’s Happening Here:

print() is a built-in Python function.

It displays the text inside the quotes on your screen.

Output:
```bash
Hello, Python!
```


🎉 Congratulations — you’ve just written your first Python program!

# 🔍 Practice Task

Try writing and running these simple programs:

. Print your name

. Print your favorite quote

. Print “Welcome to Python Programming!”
